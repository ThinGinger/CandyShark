My game is a sort of infinite survival game. You must eat the red and green fish to get points while avoiding the pufferfish. If you eat 3 pufferfish, the game is over and restarts.

With this being a game aimed at children aimed 7-8, I chose an art style that is cartoony in nature and I though Kenny's art packs would be the best place to go. I also found the shark character on Google Images and thought it was super cute and fit the overall art-style. Overall I think the game is fun and has a decent level of difficulty and its pretty fun to move the player around.

I think given more time, I'd like to implement more UI elements such as a main menu, game over screen and a better more professional HUD. Additionally adding more polish like little bubble particle effects behind the player and fish and some interesting effect when you eat a good fish or bad fish. I think the game needs more feedback when you made a mistake. Sound effects would be great to provide feedback as well.

This was a nice experience. Almost like a 4 hour Game Jam. I hope you enjoy!
